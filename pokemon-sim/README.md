#### About
A clone of the very first battle in the first generation of Pokémon GAMEBOY games by Game Freak published by Nintendo.

This originally started as a project to refine my web development skills, but then it evolved to include (originally, perhaps not in the current iteration) `PHP`, `GET` requests, `jQuery`, `JSON` to dynamically call specific monsters from an index (Pokédex), `API` usage, `SVG`, dynamic SVG coloring, CSS 3D `transforms`, responsive interfaces based on `em` units, and full mastery of `SASS` and `SCSS`.

I plan to move the project into React & Redux next to get a hold on those new technologies as well.
